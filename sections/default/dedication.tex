This work is dedicated to my high school physics teacher, Mr. Paul Thompson.

\noindent
His enthusiasm and passion for teaching has helped to inspire countless students throughout his career.
Without the interest in physics and dedication towards learning that he instilled in me during his class, it is unlikely I would have started on the path which led me here today.
I owe Mr. Thompson a tremendous amount of gratitude for starting me on this journey, and for the success I have achieved along the way.
