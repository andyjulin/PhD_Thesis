We measure the production cross section of $\ee \rightarrow \psipptoDD$ around the nominal mass of the $\psipp$. 
The \SI{69.80 \pm 0.03}{\invpb} of $\ee$ annihilation data used were collected in 2010 over an energy range of \SIrange{3.735}{3.870}{\GeV}.
Since the previously observed $\ee \rightarrow \DDbar$ cross section cannot be explained by a single Breit-Wigner shape, this study investigates if interference effects from non-resonant $\DDbar$ production can account for the $\DDbar$ cross section shape.
