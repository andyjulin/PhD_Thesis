We measure the production cross section of $\ee \rightarrow \psipptoDD$ near the peak of the $\psipp$ resonance. 
The \SI{69.80 \pm 0.03}{\invpb} of $\ee$ annihilation data used were collected in 2010 over a center-of-mass energy range of \SIrange{3.735}{3.870}{\GeV}.
From previously observed $\ee \rightarrow \DDbar$ cross section measurements, this shape cannot be explained by a single Breit-Wigner.
Instead, in this analysis we fitted the cross section by including interference effects from non-resonant $\DDbar$ production, and measured the mass and width of the $\psipp$ more precisely than previous results.
